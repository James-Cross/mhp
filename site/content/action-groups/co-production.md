    **The Co-production Action Group aims to** ensure that people with lived
    experience are involved in the partnership in a meaningful way.


    **S﻿ome examples of projects that the group has worked on** include putting on co – production training for co – chairs of other action groups. They are looking to do another set of training, even more enriching, for people within the MHP and outside agencies. It will focus on: informing people with lived experience on how to get involved in homeless strategy projects and how organisations can involve these people as well.  


    **Get involved:** Please contact co – chair [Harris@boothcentre.org.uk](mailto:Harris@boothcentre.org.uk)to find out more. He is particularly calling on people with lived experience from outside the Booth Centre to join the group!
