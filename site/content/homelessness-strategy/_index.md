    The [Manchester City Strategy](lob:https://mhp.org.uk/3e6128c3-25ff-49da-886b-99c7f018154f) for ending homelessness has three main aims:


    1. To make homelessness rare: increasing prevention and early intervention

    2. To make homelessness as brief as possible: improving temporary and supported accommodation so it becomes a positive experience

    3. To make any experiences of homelessness a one-off occurrence: increasing access to settled homes


    The strategy was co-produced by members of Manchester Homelessness Partnership. This includes people who have personal insight into homelessness, people who work for the Council, and people who work in frontline charity services. As far as we are aware, this is the first time a city in the UK has developed a strategy in this way.


    We believe that to end homelessness in all it's forms in Manchester, we have to work together towards a whole city response. We have asked each sector to create an action plan for how they can work to meet the requirements of this strategy. This includes responses from the council, health, housing, the voluntary sector, and businesses.
