    At the heart of the Partnership are our Action Groups, which tackle specific
    challenges that people who are homeless may face. Each group includes people
    who have experienced the topic in question, as well as those who have
    relevant skills or professional expertise.  


    We are open to anyone who shares our goal of ending homelessness in Manchester – please sign up to an Action Group using our form [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=XVwzcf1bkE61VN8N5KjjQjkoCHBJKMVKuWG3gz25EypUM1gxNTZLNUgwS0tGNUhNVkExNUJPRkY5Ni4u), or get in touch via email at [info@mhp.org.uk](mailto:info@mhp.org.uk) for more information.
