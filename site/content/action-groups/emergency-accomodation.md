    The Emergency Accommodation Action Group takes a holistic look at temporary
    provision of accommodation in the city, including winter night shelters, and
    move-on accommodation. 


    On Friday 30th August 2019 the action group launched Manchesterâ€™s Emergency
    Accommodation Minimum Standards. The launch marks the outcome of months of
    significant collaborative efforts.


    The minimum standards and vision for 2022 are to ensure that Manchester has
    the highest possible standards for emergency accommodation to help people
    who are rough sleeping to make the choice to move inside. These standards
    have been drawn up with people who have experience of staying in emergency
    accommodation and people who provide and commission accommodation and
    support services.
