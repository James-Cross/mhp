    The Manchester Homelessness Partnership formed to work together towards the
    aims and values of the Manchester Homelessness Charter.


    Launched in May 2016, the charter unites many people with personal
    experience of homelessness with organisations from different sectors, to
    co-produce solutions together. Over 100 people with lived experience have
    been involved so far, many of whom were involved in co-writing the charter.

    At the heart of the Partnership are the [actions
    groups](https://charter.streetsupport.net/join-action-group/), who each
    tackle a key challenge that people experiencing homelessness regularly face.
    Each group includes people who have experienced this issue personally, as
    well as those who have relevant skills or professional expertise.


    There is also a [partnership board
    ](https://charter.streetsupport.net/partnership-board/)that has been set up
    to use its collective influence to remove systemic blockages. The driving
    group provides support for the action groups, and protects the aims and
    values of the charter.


    [Street Support Network](https://streetsupport.net) has supported the
    charter mission from the start, and are part of the driving group. Their
    role is to facilitate the network, to help connect people, and to
    communicate between the partnership and out to others in the city through
    their website, apps and other channels. You can [join the mhp mailing list
