    The Manchester Homelessness Partnership (MHP) is a network of organisations
    which formed to work together towards the aims and values of the Manchester
    Homelessness Charter. Our goal is to end homelessness in all its forms in
    Manchester.


    The charter was launched in May 2016. It unites many people with personal
    experience of homelessness with organisations from different sectors, to
    co-produce solutions together. Over 100 people with lived experience have
    been involved in the Partnership, many of whom co-wrote the charter.


    Nearly all of our work is done voluntarily but in April 2018 we welcomed two
    full time roles to support the Partnership and promote the values of the
    charter.

    At the heart of the Partnership are the [actions
    groups](https://charter.streetsupport.net/join-action-group/), which each
    tackle a key challenge that people who are homeless may regularly face. Each
    group includes people who have personally experienced the topic in question,
    as well as those who have relevant skills and roles. The action groups cover
    a variety of subjects, including; Prevention, Migration & Destitution,
    Employment, Mental Health, Evening Services, Unsupported Temporary
    Accomodation, and the experiences of Women and Young People.


    We also have a [partnership
    board,](https://charter.streetsupport.net/partnership-board/) chaired by
    Bishop David, where different perspectives from our city are represented.
    This includes, of course, people who have personal insight into
    homelessness. The board meets quarterly to use its collective influence to
    remove any systemic blockages that our network are facing. Finally, we have
    a driving group that maintains momentum, provides support for the action
    groups, and protects the aims and values of the charter.


    The 'glue' of the Manchester Homelessness Partnership is [Street Support
    Network](https://streetsupport.net) which has supported the charter mission
    from the start. Their team host the two roles and they are part of the
    driving group. They facilitate the network, help connect people, and
    communicate between the partnership and out to others in the city through
    their website, app and other channels.
