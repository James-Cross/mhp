    The Manchester Homelessness Partnership formed to work together towards the
    aims and values of the Manchester Homelessness Charter.


    Launched in May 2016, the charter unites many people with personal
    experience of homelessness wih organisations from different sectors, to
    co-produce solutions together. Over 90 people with lived experience have
    been involved so far, many of whom were involved in co-writing the charter.
