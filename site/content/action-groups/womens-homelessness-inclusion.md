  body: "![The sessions are now held on the first Wednesday of each month at the
    Pankhurst Centre drop-in for women. The sessions are user-led and begin with
    completion of an assessment form to ensure the support we offer is specific
    to women's needs. We offer 1-1 support on the 5 basic digital skills that
    everyone should have. These include:  managing information, communication,
    transacting, problem-solving and creating. We also offer support on specific
    topics or skills that users want to learn. We provide smart phones, tablets,
    free SIM cards with data from Vodafone, free lunch and we can also cover
    travel expenses. ](assets/uploads/digital-skills-workshops-for-women-new.png
