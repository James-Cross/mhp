    aims and values of the Manchester Homelessness Charter.


    Launched in May 2016, the charter unites many people with personal
    experience of homelessness wih organisations from different sectors, to
    co-produce solutions together. Over 90 people with lived experience have
    been involved so far, many of whom were involved in co-writing the charter.
